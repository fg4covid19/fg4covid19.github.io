<h1>The International Workshop on Face and Gesture Analysis for COVID-19 FG4COVID19</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" id="description">
	<p> Since the end of 2019, the whole world has been living with the effects of the COVID-19 disease. Due to the airborne nature of the novel coronavirus, the COVID-19 disease has spread rapidly in many countries in a short time and has also been declared a global pandemic. Several preventive measures were implemented to reduce the spread of this disease, including social distancing, wearing face masks, avoiding large crowds, and others.</p>
	<p>To help monitor public behavior and compliance with the implemented prevention measures, to gather reliable data for epidemiological models, facilitate authorized access and authentication, ensure safety and security despite the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to develop automated machine learning and computer vision based techniques that can help with these tasks. The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated research and development of computer-aided systems that can be used to prevent and monitor not only COVID-19 but also similar diseases that may appear in the future.</p> 
	<p>The goal of this workshop is to present the most recent and advanced work related to face and gesture analysis in the scope of COVID-19. We are interested in all COVID-19 related studies that focus on the detection of face mask, subjects' behaviors in public areas, analysis of pandemic and preventions-related real-world face and gesture data, prevention control and monitoring systems for unconstrained real-world conditions and related problems. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

Face mask detection,
Masked face detection and recognition,
Face-hand interaction detection,
COVID-19 monitoring and control systems related to face and gesture analysis,
Social distance tracking and control systems,
Dataset bias analysis on COVID-19 datasets (face mask, face-hand, social distance,...),
Face, gesture and body analysis for monitoring intervention-measure compliance
Behavior understanding relevant for COVID-19,
Analysis of social interactions relevant to COVID-19,
Soft-biometric analysis on masked faces (age, gender, ...),
Generative models relevant in the scope of COVID-19,
Novel datasets and performance benchmarks,
Related applications.
