<h2>The International Workshop on Face and Gesture Analysis for COVID-19</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" id="description">
	<p> Since the end of 2019, the whole world has been living with the effects of the COVID-19 disease. Due to the airborne nature of the novel coronavirus, the COVID-19 disease has spread rapidly in many countries in a short time and has also been declared a global pandemic. Several preventive measures were implemented to reduce the spread of this disease, including social distancing, wearing face masks, avoiding large crowds, and others.</p>
	<p>To help monitor public behavior and compliance with the implemented prevention measures, to gather reliable data for epidemiological models, facilitate authorized access and authentication, ensure safety and security despite the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to develop automated machine learning and computer vision based techniques that can help with these tasks. The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated research and development of computer-aided systems that can be used to prevent and monitor not only COVID-19 but also similar diseases that may appear in the future.</p> 
	<p>The goal of this workshop is to present the most recent and advanced work related to face and gesture analysis in the scope of COVID-19. We are interested in all COVID-19 related studies that focus on the detection of face mask, subjects' behaviors in public areas, analysis of pandemic and preventions-related real-world face and gesture data, prevention control and monitoring systems for unconstrained real-world conditions and related problems. </p>
	
	<p> Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):	
	<ul>
		<li>Face mask detection,</li>
		<li>Masked face detection and recognition,</li>
		<li>Face-hand interaction detection,</li>
		<li>COVID-19 monitoring and control systems related to face and gesture analysis,</li>
		<li>Social distance tracking and control systems,</li>
		<li>Dataset bias analysis on COVID-19 datasets (face mask, face-hand, social distance,...),</li>
		<li>Face, gesture and body analysis for monitoring intervention-measure compliance,</li>
		<li>Behavior understanding relevant for COVID-19,</li>
		<li>Analysis of social interactions relevant to COVID-19,</li>
		<li>Soft-biometric analysis on masked faces (age, gender, ...),</li>
		<li>Generative models relevant in the scope of COVID-19,</li>
		<li>Novel datasets and performance benchmarks,</li>
		<li>Related applications.</li>
		
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p class="font-weight-bold">Paper submission:</p> <p>Authors should follow the official FG 2021 paper formatting instructions available from: <a href="http://iab-rubric.org/fg2021/submission.html">FG2021.</a> Note that FG4COVID19 does not have a short-paper category, so all submissions should be up to 8 pages including references. Paper submission should be done through the CMT System: CMT Link. </p>

	<p>Selected papers from the first submission round will be invited to submit extended versions of their work to <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/image-and-vision-computing/call-for-papers/deep-learning-techniques-applied-to-faces">a special issue</a> organized in the Image and Vision Computing journal.</p>
